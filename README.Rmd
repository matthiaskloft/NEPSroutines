# NEPSroutines

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

NEPSroutines is an R package that provides a collection of functions for the
scaling of NEPS competence data. It implements standardized scaling routines for
one- and two-parametric logistic models with binary and polytomous responses.

## Features
 
- Analyses of descriptive information, missing values, distractors,
  dimensionality, and differential item functioning
- Generation of item and respondent scores for NEPS scientific use files
- General data preparation and consistency checks
- Quarto extension and functionalities for semi-automated technical reports

## Installation

You can install the development version of NEPSroutines from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

```r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("matthiaskloft/NEPSroutines")
```

## Dependencies

NEPSroutines requires R >= 4.3.0 and depends on several packages including:

- TAM (>= 4.2)
- dplyr
- ggplot2
- haven
- openxlsx
- psych
- tidyr
- WrightMap

## Usage

```r
library(NEPSroutines)
```

### Example: Sample Descriptives

```r
# Sample size by (in)valid cases
NEPSroutines::n_valid(resp = resp, valid = 'valid')

# Sample size by grouping variable
NEPSroutines::sample_by_group(
  resp = resp,
  grouping_variable = 'difficulty',
  labels = c('EasyTestlet' = 0, 'DifficultTestlet' = 1)
)

# Descriptives of continuous variables
NEPSroutines::desc_con(resp = resp, desc = 'age', valid = 'valid')
```

### Example: Technical Reports

Technical reports can be created using a Quarto extension provided in the
package:
  
```r
# Set up Quarto extension and template
NEPSroutines::Setup("path/to/technical_report_folder")
```

For more details, see the vignette on semi-automated technical reports.
