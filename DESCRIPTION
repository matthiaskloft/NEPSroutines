Description: This package contains a collection of functions for the
    scaling of NEPS competence data. It provides standardized scaling
    routines for one- and two-parametric logistic models with binary and 
    polytomous responses. It supports analyses of descriptive information, 
    missing values, distractors, dimensionality, and differential item
    functioning. Also, it can generate item and respondent scores 
    for the scientific use files in the NEPS. Additionally, several
    functions support general data preparation and consistency checks of the
    data. Finally, the package includes a Quarto extension and functionalities
    for the creation of semi-automated technical reports.
